# 🧪 Welcome to Fabalos Sandbox

**Fabalos Sandbox** is an internal build environment for experiments, systems, and workflows under the Fabalos ecosystem.

This repository is **not a polished product**, **not a template**, and **not a public-facing portfolio**.
It is a working sandbox where ideas are tested, broken, rebuilt, and validated.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This sandbox exists to:

- Prototype dashboards, forms, and internal tools
- Test Supabase schemas, auth flows, and CRUD logic
- Build and refine blog, case study, and content systems
- Experiment with SvelteKit + Tailwind v4 architecture
- Validate ideas **before** extracting them into clean, reusable projects

If something looks unfinished or inconsistent — that’s intentional.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit**
- **Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first architecture)**
- **Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)**
- **Vite**
- **TypeScript**

---

## ⚠️ Project Status

- 🚧 Active development
- 🔁 Refactors are normal
- 💥 Breaking changes are expected
- 🧹 Cleanup happens *after* validation, not before

This repo prioritizes **progress over polish**.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- Environment variables are required (`.env`)
- Supabase schema must match expected fields
- This repo may deploy at any point, even if features are incomplete

---

## 📂 Structure Notes

- `(secure)/` routes are protected/internal
- Blog and Case Study systems are under active iteration
- UI consistency comes *after* data + logic stability

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

> Build first. Clean later.
> Validate reality before aesthetics.
